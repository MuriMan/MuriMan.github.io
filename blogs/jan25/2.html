		<h1>Mathematics and the populus</h1>
		<p>January 2025.</p>

	<p>
		Humanity's greatest achievement is mathematics. It is also the most hated of humanity's
		creations, whilst being, to some people, very loved. I would like to speak my mind
		about the duality of maths through this weblog.
	</p>
	<p>
		Mathematics emerged as ways to quantify quantities. Starting as a way to keep track of
		grain and finance, to quantifying the workings of the universe. That is all mathematics
		is, representations of amounts and relationships between multiple of these amounts.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since childhood, the majority of the schooled population of earth are taught to blindly
		memorise instructions on how to <i>do maths</i>. Countless methods have emerged to teach
		children counting, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, some more 
		frustrating than others. In fact, for a large part of humanity, this is where the hatred
		against mathematics sprouts. For the basic operations mentioned, often these are the only
		ways to teach not only children, but rather, anybody.
	</p>
	<p>
		The problem arises when fractions are discussed. Around this time, maths is completely
		disassociated from the reality of its concepts, that of the dealing of amounts. Students
		are given instructions on how fractions can be added, subtracted, divided and multiplied,
		and are often left with no clue as to why the instructions are what they are. Students
		are taught to blindly practice pages upon pages of such exercises, of which they will
		get a lot wrong, for which they will be penalised, creating spite and resentment against
		an inanimate set of thoughts.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have personally went down this route. Famillial pressures forced into me anxiety
		regarding maths, which anxiety followed me into exam halls and the plethora of sub-par
		results. I came to the multiple <i>epiphanies</i> once school started after lockdown.
		Certain social situations led me to end up spending hours with no distractions. In this
		time, I stayed in my head <i>thinking</i> about what school taught me. It started with
		the concepts of algebra, and the physical implications of algebraic operations. Slowly,
		mathematics revealed to me, its beauty.
	</p>
	<p>
		I believe, the majority of school systems should adopt methods that uphold 
		<i>understanding over memorisation</i>. This includes testing systems that reward 
		the former over the latter, opposite to what is currently effective. Such a system
		should, in fact, develop generally intelligent adults, that occasionally intelligent
		individuals.
