		<h2 id="core-idea-1-minute-">Core Idea (1 minute)</h2>
		<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use a <strong>modded version of Cities: Skylines 2</strong> to simulate Dhaka‚Äôs urban dynamics, enabling cost-effective, detailed analysis of proposed changes.  </p>
		<ul>
			<li><p><strong>Why Cities: Skylines 2?</strong>  </p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Customization:</strong> The game allows detailed city-building with adjustable parameters for traffic, zoning, utilities, and public services.  </li>
					<li><strong>Affordability:</strong> Requires only a capable PC, not high-cost infrastructure.  </li>
					<li><strong>Community Support:</strong> Offers a rich ecosystem of mods and tools for highly accurate simulations.  </li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><p><strong>Steps to Implement:</strong>  </p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Model Creation:</strong> Build a scaled version of Dhaka in Cities: Skylines 2 using open-source geospatial data, like OSM (OpenStreetMap), to replicate road networks, landmarks, and population density.  </li>
					<li><strong>Problem Identification:</strong> Use the simulation to highlight current issues such as congestion hotspots, waste management inefficiencies, or insufficient green spaces.  </li>
					<li><strong>Tech Solutions Testing:</strong> Experiment with various interventions, including:  <ul>
							<li>Smart traffic lights synchronized via AI algorithms.  </li>
							<li>Dedicated lanes for public transport.  </li>
							<li>Waste-to-energy plants for sustainable waste management.  </li>
							<li>Smart sensors for water and energy usage.  </li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Cost-Benefit Analysis:</strong> Assess each intervention&#39;s impact and financial feasibility through in-game data metrics and performance dashboards.  </li>
				</ol>
			</li>
